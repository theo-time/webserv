The listen directive can be set to:

An IP address/port combo.
A lone IP address which will then listen on the default port 80.
A lone port which will listen to every interface on that port.
The path to a Unix socket.

Nginx translates all “incomplete” listen directives by substituting missing values with their default values so that each block can be evaluated by its IP address and port. Some examples of these translations are:
A block with no listen directive uses the value 0.0.0.0:80.
A block set to an IP address 111.111.111.111 with no port becomes 111.111.111.111:80
A block set to port 8888 with no IP address becomes 0.0.0.0:8888
